Clicking on a theme will show you the gear for that theme in that slot.\nThis includes Dyes!!!\n\n/fr - opens up main window.\n/fashionreport - Main Window\n\nThis project was made possible by a woman who took the time to figure out the proper pointing system and organize the fashion report data for me. She is the heart of this project. Her data made dye calculation possible.\n\nFuture Updates:\nAutomatic teleporting and moving to NPCs that sell pieces.",
